//! Asupersync Transfer Protocol data movement primitives.

//! ATP is the project-owned data movement layer that combines native QUIC,
//! verified object graphs, resumable transfer journals, adaptive RaptorQ
//! repair, path establishment, and deterministic replay. The module starts
//! small on purpose: each submodule should expose a reusable, testable model
//! before endpoint, CLI, daemon, or relay code depends on it.
